# The Spider — API Contract

Status: **Ready — MVP**

Package: `@shardworks/spider-apparatus` · Plugin id: `spider`

> **⚠️ MVP scope.** This spec covers a static rig graph: every commission gets the same five-engine pipeline (`draft → implement → review → revise → seal`). No origination, no dynamic extension, no capability resolution. The Spider runs engines directly — the Executor earns its independence later. See [What This Spec Does NOT Cover](#what-this-spec-does-not-cover) for the full list.

---

## Purpose

The Spider is the spine of the guild's rigging system. It runs a structured engine pipeline for each commission, advancing the rig one step at a time via a `crawl()` step function.

The Spider owns the rig's structural lifecycle — spawn, traverse, complete — and delegates everything else. Engine designs come from the Fabricator. Sessions come from the Animator. Draft bindings come from the Scriptorium. Writ transitions are handled by a CDC handler, not inline. The Spider itself is stateless between `crawl()` calls; all state lives in the Stacks.

---

## Dependencies

```
requires: ['fabricator', 'clerk', 'stacks']
```

- **The Fabricator** — resolves engine designs by `designId`.
- **The Clerk** — queries ready writs; receives writ transitions via CDC.
- **The Stacks** — persists rigs book, reads sessions book, hosts CDC handler on rigs book.

Engines pull their own apparatus dependencies (Scriptorium, Animator, Loom) via the `guild()` singleton — these are not Spider dependencies.

### Reference docs

- **The Rigging System** (`docs/architecture/rigging.md`) — full rigging architecture (Spider, Fabricator, Executor, Manifester). This spec implements a subset.
- **The Fabricator** (`docs/architecture/apparatus/fabricator.md`) — engine design registry and `EngineDesign` type definitions.
- **The Scriptorium** (`docs/architecture/apparatus/scriptorium.md`) — draft binding API (`openDraft`, `seal`, `abandonDraft`).
- **The Animator** (`docs/architecture/apparatus/animator.md`) — session API (`summon`, `animate`), `AnimateHandle`, `SessionResult`.
- **The Clerk** (`docs/architecture/apparatus/clerk.md`) — writ lifecycle API.
- **The Stacks** (`docs/architecture/apparatus/stacks.md`) — CDC phases, cascade vs notification, `watch()` API.

---

## The Engine Interface

Engines are the unit of work in a rig. Each engine implements a standard interface defined by the Fabricator apparatus (`@shardworks/fabricator-apparatus`). The `EngineDesign`, `EngineRunContext`, and `EngineRunResult` types are owned and exported by the Fabricator — see the Fabricator spec (`docs/architecture/apparatus/fabricator.md`) for full type definitions. Engines pull their own apparatus dependencies via `guild().apparatus(...)` — same pattern as tool handlers.

The Spider resolves engine designs by `designId` from the Fabricator at runtime: `fabricator.getEngineDesign(id)`.

### Kit contribution

The Spider contributes its five engine designs via its support kit:

```typescript
// In spider-apparatus plugin
supportKit: {
  engines: {
    'draft':          draftEngine,
    'implement':      implementEngine,
    'review':         reviewEngine,
    'revise':         reviseEngine,
    'seal':           sealEngine,
    'anima-session':  animaSessionEngine,
  },
  tools: [crawlOneTool, crawlContinualTool],
},
```

The Fabricator scans kit `engines` contributions at startup (same pattern as the Instrumentarium scanning tools). The Spider contributes its engines like any other kit — no special registration path.

---

## The Walk Function

The Spider's core is a single step function:

```typescript
interface SpiderApi {
  /**
   * Examine guild state and perform the single highest-priority action.
   * Returns a description of what was done, or null if there's nothing to do.
   */
  crawl(): Promise<CrawlResult | null>
}

type CrawlResult =
  | { action: 'engine-completed'; rigId: string; engineId: string }
  | { action: 'engine-started'; rigId: string; engineId: string }
  | { action: 'rig-spawned'; rigId: string; writId: string }
  | { action: 'rig-completed'; rigId: string; writId: string; outcome: 'completed' | 'failed' }
```

Each `crawl()` call does exactly one thing. The priority ordering:

1. **Collect a completed engine.** Scan all running rigs for an engine with `status === 'running'`. Read the session record from the sessions book by `engine.sessionId`. If the session has reached a terminal status (`completed` or `failed`), update the engine: set its status and populate its yields (or error). **Yield assembly:** look up the `EngineDesign` by `designId` from the Fabricator. If the design defines a `collect(sessionId, givens, context)` method, call it to assemble the yields — passing the same givens and context that were passed to `run()`. Otherwise, use the generic default: `{ sessionId, sessionStatus, output? }`. This keeps engine-specific yield logic (e.g. parsing review findings) in the engine, not the Spider. If the engine failed, mark the rig `failed` (same transaction). If the completed engine is the terminal engine (`seal`), mark the rig `completed` (same transaction). Rig status changes trigger the CDC handler (see below). Returns `rig-completed` if the rig transitioned, otherwise `engine-completed`. This is the first priority because it unblocks downstream engines.
2. **Run a ready engine.** An engine is ready when `status === 'pending'` and all engines in its `upstream` array have `status === 'completed'`. Look up the `EngineDesign` by `designId` from the Fabricator. Assemble givens (from givensSpec) and context (with upstream yields), then call `design.run(givens, context)`. For clockwork engines (`status: 'completed'` result): store the yields on the engine instance, mark it completed, and check for rig completion (same as step 1). Returns `engine-completed` (or `rig-completed` if this was the terminal engine). For quick engines (`status: 'launched'` result): store the `sessionId`, mark the engine `running`. Returns `engine-started`. Completion is collected on subsequent crawl calls via step 1.
3. **Spawn a rig.** If there's a ready writ with no rig, spawn the static graph. Returns `rig-spawned`.

If nothing qualifies at any level, return null (the guild is idle or all work is blocked on running quick engines).

### Operational model

The Spider exports two tools:

```
nsg crawl-continual   # starts polling loop, crawls every ~5s, runs indefinitely
nsg crawl-one         # single step (useful for debugging/testing)
```

The `crawl-continual` loop: call `crawl()`, sleep `pollIntervalMs` (default 5000), repeat. When `crawl()` returns null, the loop doesn't stop — it keeps polling. New writs posted via `nsg commission-post` from a separate terminal are picked up on the next poll cycle. Pass `--maxIdleCycles N` to stop after N consecutive idle cycles.

---

## Rig Data Model

### Rig

```typescript
interface Rig {
  id: string
  writId: string
  status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  engines: EngineInstance[]
}
```

Stored in the Stacks `rigs` book. One rig per writ. The Spider reads and updates rigs via normal Stacks `put()`/`patch()` operations.

### Engine Instance

```typescript
interface EngineInstance {
  id: string               // unique within the rig, e.g. 'draft', 'implement', 'review', 'revise', 'seal'
  designId: string         // engine design id — resolved from the Fabricator
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'
  upstream: string[]       // ids of engines that must complete first (empty = first engine)
  givensSpec: Record<string, unknown>  // givens specification — literal values now, templates later
  yields: unknown          // set on completion — the engine's yields (see Yield Types below)
  error?: string           // set on failure
  sessionId?: string       // set when run() returns 'launched' — Spider polls for completion
  startedAt?: string       // ISO-8601, set when engine begins running (enables future timeout detection)
  completedAt?: string     // ISO-8601, set when engine reaches terminal status
}
```

An engine is **ready** when: `status === 'pending'` and all engines in its `upstream` array have `status === 'completed'`.

### The Static Graph

Every spawned rig gets this engine list:

```typescript
function spawnStaticRig(writ: Writ, config: SpiderConfig): EngineInstance[] {
  return [
    { id: 'draft',     designId: 'draft',     status: 'pending', upstream: [],
      givensSpec: { writ }, yields: null },
    { id: 'implement', designId: 'implement', status: 'pending', upstream: ['draft'],
      givensSpec: { writ, role: config.role }, yields: null },
    { id: 'review',    designId: 'review',    status: 'pending', upstream: ['implement'],
      givensSpec: { writ, role: 'reviewer', buildCommand: config.buildCommand, testCommand: config.testCommand }, yields: null },
    { id: 'revise',    designId: 'revise',    status: 'pending', upstream: ['review'],
      givensSpec: { writ, role: config.role }, yields: null },
    { id: 'seal',      designId: 'seal',      status: 'pending', upstream: ['revise'],
      givensSpec: {}, yields: null },
  ]
}
```

The `givensSpec` is populated from the Spider's config at rig spawn time. The rig is self-contained after spawning — no runtime config lookups needed. The `writ` is passed as a given to engines that need it (most do; `seal` doesn't). All engines start with `yields: null` — yields are populated when the engine completes (see [Yield Types](#yield-types-and-data-flow)).

The rig is **completed** when the terminal engine (`seal`) has `status === 'completed'`. The rig is **failed** when any engine has `status === 'failed'`.

---

## Yield Types and Data Flow

Each engine produces typed yields that downstream engines consume. The yields are stored on the `EngineInstance.yields` field in the Stacks.

**Serialization constraint:** Because yields are persisted to the Stacks (JSON-backed), all yield values **must be JSON-serializable**. The Spider should validate this at storage time — if an engine returns a non-serializable value (function, circular reference, etc.), the engine fails with a clear error. This is important because engines are a plugin extension point — kit authors need a hard boundary, not a silent corruption.

When the Spider runs an engine, it assembles givens from the givensSpec. Givens template expressions using `${yields.*}` syntax are resolved at engine start time from upstream yields (see [Givens Template Expressions](#givens-template-expressions)). All upstream yields are also available via the `context.upstream` escape hatch:

```typescript
function assembleGivensAndContext(rig: Rig, engine: EngineInstance) {
  // Collect all completed engine yields for the context escape hatch.
  // All completed yields are included regardless of graph distance —
  // simpler than chain-walking and equivalent for the static graph.
  const upstream: Record<string, unknown> = {}
  for (const e of rig.engines) {
    if (e.status === 'completed' && e.yields !== undefined) {
      upstream[e.id] = e.yields
    }
  }

  // Givens = givensSpec only. Upstream data stays on context.
  const givens = { ...engine.givensSpec }

  const context: EngineRunContext = {
    engineId: engine.id,
    upstream,
  }

  return { givens, context }
}
```

Givens contain only what the givensSpec declares — static values set at rig spawn time (writ, role, buildCommand, etc.). Engines that need upstream data (worktree path, review findings, etc.) pull it from `context.upstream` by engine id. This keeps the givens contract clean: what you see in the givensSpec is exactly what the engine receives.

### `DraftYields`

```typescript
interface DraftYields {
  draftId: string         // the draft binding's unique id (from DraftRecord.id)
  codexName: string       // which codex this draft is on (from DraftRecord.codexName)
  branch: string          // git branch name for the draft (from DraftRecord.branch)
  path: string            // absolute path to the draft worktree (from DraftRecord.path)
  baseSha: string         // commit SHA at draft open — used to compute diffs later
}
```

**Produced by:** `draft` engine
**Consumed by:** all downstream engines. Establishes the physical workspace.

> **Note:** Field names mirror the Scriptorium's `DraftRecord` type (`codexName`, `branch`, `path`) rather than inventing Spider-specific aliases. `baseSha` is the only field the draft engine adds itself — by reading `HEAD` after opening the draft.

### `ImplementYields`

```typescript
interface ImplementYields {
  sessionId: string
  sessionStatus: 'completed' | 'failed'
  conversationId?: string
}
```

**Produced by:** `implement` engine (set by Spider's collect step when session completes)
**Consumed by:** `review` (needs to know the session completed)

### Default Quick-Engine Yields

Quick engines that define no custom `collect` method receive the generic default yields:

```typescript
interface DefaultQuickYields {
  sessionId: string
  sessionStatus: 'completed' | 'failed'
  output?: string
  conversationId?: string
}
```

The `conversationId` is included when the session provider supports conversation resumption (e.g., Claude Code's `--resume`). This enables conversation chaining across engines via `${yields.<engineId>.conversationId}` in rig template givens. The `anima-session` engine relies on this for multi-step workflows where downstream engines resume an upstream engine's conversation.

### `ReviewYields`

```typescript
interface ReviewYields {
  sessionId: string
  passed: boolean                      // reviewer's overall assessment
  findings: string                     // structured markdown: what passed, what's missing, what's wrong
  mechanicalChecks: MechanicalCheck[]  // build/test results run before the reviewer session
}

interface MechanicalCheck {
  name: 'build' | 'test'
  passed: boolean
  output: string    // stdout+stderr, truncated to 4KB
  durationMs: number
}
```

**Produced by:** `review` engine
**Consumed by:** `revise` (needs `passed` to decide whether to do work, needs `findings` as context)

The `mechanicalChecks` are run by the engine *before* launching the reviewer session — their results are included in the reviewer's prompt.

### `ReviseYields`

```typescript
interface ReviseYields {
  sessionId: string
  sessionStatus: 'completed' | 'failed'
}
```

**Produced by:** `revise` engine (set by Spider's collect step when session completes)
**Consumed by:** `seal` (no data dependency — seal just needs revise to be done)

### `SealYields`

```typescript
interface SealYields {
  sealedCommit: string                     // the commit SHA at head of target after sealing (from SealResult)
  strategy: 'fast-forward' | 'rebase'      // merge strategy used (from SealResult)
  retries: number                          // rebase retry attempts needed (from SealResult)
  inscriptionsSealed: number               // number of commits incorporated (from SealResult)
}
```

**Produced by:** `seal` engine
**Consumed by:** nothing (terminal). Used by the CDC handler for the writ transition resolution message.

> **Note:** Field names mirror the Scriptorium's `SealResult` type. The Scriptorium's `seal()` method pushes the target branch to the remote after sealing.

---

## Engine Implementations

Each engine is an `EngineDesign` contributed by the Spider's support kit. The engine's `run()` method receives assembled givens and a thin context, and returns an `EngineRunResult`. Engines pull apparatus dependencies via `guild().apparatus(...)`.

### `draft` (clockwork)

Opens a draft binding on the commission's target codex.

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, _context: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const scriptorium = guild().apparatus<ScriptoriumApi>('codexes')
  const writ = givens.writ as Writ
  const draft = await scriptorium.openDraft({ codexName: writ.codex, associatedWith: writ.id })
  const baseSha = await getHeadSha(draft.path)

  return {
    status: 'completed',
    yields: { draftId: draft.id, codexName: draft.codexName, branch: draft.branch, path: draft.path, baseSha } satisfies DraftYields,
  }
}
```

### `implement` (quick)

Summons an anima to do the commissioned work.

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, context: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const animator = guild().apparatus<AnimatorApi>('animator')
  const writ = givens.writ as Writ
  const draft = context.upstream.draft as DraftYields

  const prompt = `${writ.body}\n\nCommit all changes before ending your session.`

  const handle = animator.summon({
    role: givens.role as string,
    prompt,
    cwd: draft.path,
    environment: { GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: `${writ.id}@nexus.local` },
    metadata: { engineId: context.engineId, writId: writ.id },
  })

  return { status: 'launched', sessionId: handle.sessionId }
}
```

The implement engine wraps the writ body with a commit instruction — each engine owns its own prompt contract rather than relying on `dispatch.sh` to append instructions to the writ body.

**Collect step:** The implement engine has no `collect` method — the Spider uses the generic default: `{ sessionId, sessionStatus, output? }`.

### `review` (quick)

Runs mechanical checks, then summons a reviewer anima to assess the implementation.

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, context: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const animator = guild().apparatus<AnimatorApi>('animator')
  const writ = givens.writ as Writ
  const draft = context.upstream.draft as DraftYields

  // 1. Run mechanical checks synchronously
  const checks: MechanicalCheck[] = []
  if (givens.buildCommand) {
    checks.push(await runCheck('build', givens.buildCommand as string, draft.path))
  }
  if (givens.testCommand) {
    checks.push(await runCheck('test', givens.testCommand as string, draft.path))
  }

  // 2. Compute diff since draft opened
  const diff = await gitDiff(draft.path, draft.baseSha)
  const status = await gitStatus(draft.path)

  // 3. Assemble review prompt
  const prompt = assembleReviewPrompt(writ, diff, status, checks)

  // 4. Launch reviewer session
  const handle = animator.summon({
    role: givens.role as string,
    prompt,
    cwd: draft.path,
    metadata: {
      engineId: context.engineId,
      writId: writ.id,
      mechanicalChecks: checks,  // stash for collect step to retrieve
    },
  })

  return { status: 'launched', sessionId: handle.sessionId }
}
```

**Review prompt template:**

```markdown
# Code Review

You are reviewing work on a commission. Your job is to assess whether the
implementation satisfies the spec, identify any gaps or problems, and produce
a structured findings document.

## The Commission (Spec)

{writ.body}

## Implementation Diff

Changes since the draft was opened:

```diff
{git diff draft.baseSha..HEAD in worktree}
```

## Current Worktree State

```
{git status --porcelain}
```

## Mechanical Check Results

{for each check}
### {name}: {PASSED | FAILED}
```
{output, truncated to 4KB}
```
{end for}

## Instructions

Assess the implementation against the spec. Produce your findings in this format:

### Overall: PASS or FAIL

### Completeness
- Which spec requirements are addressed?
- Which are missing or partially addressed?

### Correctness
- Are there bugs, logic errors, or regressions?
- Do the tests pass? If not, what fails?

### Quality
- Code style consistent with the codebase?
- Appropriate test coverage for new code?
- Any concerns about the approach?

### Required Changes (if FAIL)
Numbered list of specific changes needed, in priority order.

Produce your findings as your final message in the format above.
```

**Collect step:** The review engine defines a `collect` method that the Spider calls when the session completes. The engine looks up the session record itself and parses the reviewer's structured findings. No file is written to the worktree (review artifacts don't belong in the codebase).

```typescript
async collect(sessionId: string, _givens: Record<string, unknown>, _context: EngineRunContext): Promise<ReviewYields> {
  const stacks = guild().apparatus<StacksApi>('stacks')
  const session = await stacks.readBook<SessionDoc>('animator', 'sessions').get(sessionId)
  const findings = session?.output ?? ''
  const passed = /^###\s*Overall:\s*PASS/mi.test(findings)
  const mechanicalChecks = (session?.metadata?.mechanicalChecks as MechanicalCheck[]) ?? []
  return { sessionId, passed, findings, mechanicalChecks }
}
```

**Dependency:** The Animator's `SessionResult.output` field (the final assistant message text) must be available for this to work. See the Animator spec (`docs/architecture/apparatus/animator.md`) — the `output` field is populated from the session provider's transcript at recording time.

### `revise` (quick)

Summons an anima to address review findings.

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, context: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const animator = guild().apparatus<AnimatorApi>('animator')
  const writ = givens.writ as Writ
  const draft = context.upstream.draft as DraftYields
  const review = context.upstream.review as ReviewYields

  const status = await gitStatus(draft.path)
  const diff = await gitDiffUncommitted(draft.path)
  const prompt = assembleRevisionPrompt(writ, review, status, diff)

  const handle = animator.summon({
    role: givens.role as string,
    prompt,
    cwd: draft.path,
    environment: { GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: `${writ.id}@nexus.local` },
    metadata: { engineId: context.engineId, writId: writ.id },
  })

  return { status: 'launched', sessionId: handle.sessionId }
}
```

**Revision prompt template:**

```markdown
# Revision Pass

You are revising prior work on a commission based on review findings.

## The Commission (Spec)

{writ.body}

## Review Findings

{review.findings}

## Review Result: {PASS | FAIL}

{if review.passed}
The review passed. No changes are required. Confirm the work looks correct
and exit. Do not make unnecessary changes or spend unnecessary time reassessing.
{else}
The review identified issues that need to be addressed. See "Required Changes"
in the findings above. Address each item, then commit your changes.
{end if}

## Current State

```
{git status --porcelain}
```

```diff
{git diff HEAD, if any uncommitted changes}
```

Commit all changes before ending your session.
```

**Collect step:** The revise engine has no `collect` method — the Spider uses the generic default: `{ sessionId, sessionStatus, output? }`.

### `anima-session` (quick)

A generic engine that summons an anima session. Unlike the other quick engines which embed prompt logic, `anima-session` is a reusable building block — the prompt, role, and conversation context are supplied entirely through givens.

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, context: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const animator = guild().apparatus<AnimatorApi>('animator')
  const writ = givens.writ as WritDoc | undefined
  const draft = context.upstream['draft'] as DraftYields | undefined

  const handle = animator.summon({
    role: givens.role as string,
    prompt: givens.prompt as string,
    cwd: givens.cwd as string ?? draft?.path,
    ...(givens.conversationId ? { conversationId: givens.conversationId as string } : {}),
    environment: writ ? { GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: `${writ.id}@nexus.local` } : {},
    metadata: { engineId: context.engineId, ...(writ ? { writId: writ.id } : {}) },
  })

  return { status: 'launched', sessionId: handle.sessionId }
}
```

**Givens:**
- `role` *(required)* — the Loom role to summon
- `prompt` *(required)* — the work prompt for this session
- `cwd` *(optional)* — working directory; falls back to `upstream.draft.path` if available
- `conversationId` *(optional)* — conversation to resume (typically wired from an upstream engine's yields via `${yields.<engineId>.conversationId}`)
- `writ` *(optional)* — the writ, if the engine needs it for git identity or metadata

**Yields:** The default quick-engine yields: `{ sessionId, sessionStatus, output?, conversationId }`. The `conversationId` in yields enables downstream engines to resume the same conversation by referencing `${yields.<engineId>.conversationId}` in their givens.

**Collect step:** No custom `collect` — uses the Spider's generic default.

This engine is contributed by the Spider's support kit alongside the five existing engines. Kit-contributed rig templates and guild-configured templates can both reference `anima-session` as a `designId`.

### `seal` (clockwork)

Closes a draft binding — either sealing (merging inscriptions) or abandoning (discarding the worktree).

**Givens:**
- `abandon` *(optional, boolean)* — when truthy, abandons the draft instead of sealing. Used by rigs that need codebase access but don't produce inscriptions (e.g. planning rigs).

```typescript
async run(givens: Record<string, unknown>, ctx: EngineRunContext): Promise<EngineRunResult> {
  const scriptorium = guild().apparatus<ScriptoriumApi>('codexes')
  const draft = ctx.upstream.draft as DraftYields

  if (givens.abandon) {
    await scriptorium.abandonDraft({
      codexName: draft.codexName,
      branch: draft.branch,
      force: true,
    })
    return { status: 'completed', yields: { abandoned: true } }
  }

  const result = await scriptorium.seal({
    codexName: draft.codexName,
    sourceBranch: draft.branch,
  })

  return {
    status: 'completed',
    yields: {
      sealedCommit: result.sealedCommit,
      strategy: result.strategy,
      retries: result.retries,
      inscriptionsSealed: result.inscriptionsSealed,
    } satisfies SealYields,
  }
}
```

The seal engine does **not** transition the writ — that's handled by the CDC handler on the rigs book.

---

## CDC Handler

The Spider registers one CDC handler at startup:

### Rig terminal state → writ transition

**Book:** `rigs`
**Phase:** Phase 1 (cascade) — the writ transition joins the same transaction as the rig update
**Trigger:** rig status transitions to `completed` or `failed`

```typescript
stacks.watch('rigs', async (event) => {
  if (event.type !== 'update') return
  const rig = event.doc
  const prev = event.prev

  // Only fire on terminal transitions
  if (prev.status === rig.status) return
  if (rig.status !== 'completed' && rig.status !== 'failed') return

  if (rig.status === 'completed') {
    const sealYields = rig.engines.find(e => e.id === 'seal')?.yields as SealYields
    await clerk.transition(rig.writId, 'completed', {
      resolution: `Sealed at ${sealYields.sealedCommit} (${sealYields.strategy}, ${sealYields.inscriptionsSealed} inscriptions).`,
    })
  } else {
    const failedEngine = rig.engines.find(e => e.status === 'failed')
    await clerk.transition(rig.writId, 'failed', {
      resolution: `Engine '${failedEngine?.id}' failed: ${failedEngine?.error ?? 'unknown error'}`,
    })
  }
})
```

Because this is Phase 1 (cascade), the writ transition joins the same transaction as the rig status update. If the Clerk call throws, the rig update rolls back too.

---

## Engine Failure

When any engine fails (throws, or a quick engine's session has `status: 'failed'`):

1. The engine is marked `status: 'failed'` with the error (detected during "collect completed engines" for quick engines, or directly during execution for clockwork engines)
2. All engines in the rig with `status === 'pending'` are set to `status: 'cancelled'` — they will never run. Engines already in `'running'`, `'completed'`, or `'failed'` are left untouched. Cancelled engines do **not** receive `completedAt` or `error` — cancellation is a consequence, not a failure.
3. The rig is marked `status: 'failed'` (same transaction as steps 1 and 2)
4. CDC fires on the rig status change → handler calls Clerk API to transition the writ to `failed`
5. The draft is **not** abandoned — preserved for patron inspection

No retry. No recovery. The patron inspects and decides what to do. This is appropriate for the static rig — see [Future Evolution](#future-evolution) for the retry/recovery direction.

Quick engine "failure" definition: if the Animator session completes with `status: 'failed'`, the engine fails. If the session completes with `status: 'completed'`, the engine succeeds — even if the anima's work is incomplete (that's the review engine's job to catch, not the Spider's).

## Future Evolution

These are known directions the Spider and its data model will grow. None are in scope for the static rig MVP.

- **Engine needs declarations.** Engine designs will declare a `needs` specification that controls which upstream yields are included and how they're mapped — making the data flow between engines explicit and type-safe.
- **Typed engine contracts.** The `Record<string, unknown>` givens map with type assertions is scaffolding. The needs/planning system will introduce typed contracts between engines — defining what each engine requires and provides. This scaffolding gets replaced, not extended.
- **Dynamic rig extension.** Capability resolution (via the Fabricator) and rig growth at runtime. Engines can declare needs that the Fabricator resolves to additional engine chains, grafted onto the rig mid-execution.
- **Retry and recovery.** The static rig has no retry. Recovery logic arrives with dynamic extension — a failed engine can trigger a recovery chain rather than failing the whole rig.
- **Engine timeouts.** The `startedAt` field on engine instances is included in the data model for future use. During the collect step, the Spider checks `startedAt` against a configurable timeout. If an engine has been running longer than the threshold, the Spider marks it failed (and optionally terminates the session).
- **Unified capability catalog.** The Fabricator may absorb tool designs from the Instrumentarium, becoming the single answer to "what can this guild do?" regardless of whether the answer is an engine or a tool.

## What This Spec Does NOT Cover

- **Origination.** Commission → rig mapping is hardcoded (static graph).
- **The Executor as a separate apparatus.** The Spider runs engines directly — clockwork engines inline, quick engines via the Animator. The Executor earns its independence when substrate switching (Docker, remote VM) is needed. Key design constraint: the Spider currently `await`s `design.run()`, meaning a slow or misbehaving engine blocks the entire crawl loop. The Executor must not have this property — engine execution should be fully non-blocking, with yields persisted to a book so the orchestrator can poll for completion. This is essential for remote and Docker runners where the process that ran the engine is not the process polling for results.
- **Concurrent rigs.** The priority system supports multiple rigs in principle, but the polling loop + single-guild model means we process one commission at a time in practice. Concurrency comes naturally when the Spider processes multiple ready engines across rigs.
- **Reviewer role curriculum/temperament.** The `reviewer` role exists with a blank identity. The review engine assembles the prompt. Loom content for the reviewer is a separate concern.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "spider": {
    "pollIntervalMs": 5000,
    "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
    "testCommand": "pnpm test",
    "variables": {
      "role": "artificer"
    }
  }
}
```

All fields optional. `pollIntervalMs` defaults to `5000`. `buildCommand` and `testCommand` are run by the review engine before launching the reviewer; omitted means those mechanical checks are skipped (reviewer anima still does spec-vs-diff assessment).

The `variables` dict contains user-defined values available in rig template givens via `${vars.<path>}`. For example, `"${vars.role}"` in a template givens entry resolves to `variables.role` at rig spawn time.

### Givens Template Expressions

Rig template givens support `${...}` template expressions that are resolved at rig spawn time or engine start time:

| Expression | Resolved to | When |
|---|---|---|
| `${writ}` | The full `WritDoc` for the spawned rig | Rig spawn time |
| `${writ.<path>}` | A field of the `WritDoc` (dot-path traversal) | Rig spawn time |
| `${vars.<path>}` | Value at `<path>` from `spiderConfig.variables` (dot-path traversal) | Rig spawn time |
| `${yields.<engineId>.<path>}` | Value at `<path>` from the named engine's yields | Engine start time (just before `run()`) |

The `${yields.*}` expressions resolve at **engine start time**, not rig spawn time — the upstream engine must have completed and produced yields before the reference can be resolved. The Spider resolves these references when assembling givens for a ready engine, reading from `context.upstream[engineId]`. If the referenced engine has not completed or the path does not exist in its yields, the givens key is omitted (same behavior as an undefined `${vars.*}` reference).

`<path>` supports dot-separated property access for nested objects (e.g., `${yields.draft.nested.prop}` resolves to `upstream['draft'].nested.prop`). Both `${vars.*}` and `${yields.*}` support arbitrary dot-path depth.

The escape sequence `\${` produces a literal `${` in the output — the expression is not interpolated.

### Full-value vs. inline resolution

When a givens value is **entirely** a single `${...}` expression (`"${writ}"`, `"${yields.reader.conversationId}"`), it resolves to the **typed value** — object, array, number, whatever the source provides. This is full-value resolution.

When a string **contains** `${...}` expressions but also has surrounding text, the Spider performs **inline interpolation** — each `${...}` expression within the string is replaced with the stringified value of the reference, leaving the rest of the string intact. This enables prompt composition with embedded dynamic content:

```json
{
  "givens": {
    "writ": "${writ}",
    "conversationId": "${yields.reader.conversationId}",
    "prompt": "Write the spec.\n\nDecisions:\n${yields.decision-review.decisionSummary}"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `writ` resolves to the full `WritDoc` object (full-value — the entire string is a single expression)
- `conversationId` resolves to a string (full-value — preserves the original type from yields)
- `prompt` resolves to a string with the `decisionSummary` interpolated inline (inline — the `${...}` is embedded in a larger string)

**Resolution rules:**
- A string that is *exactly* one `${<expr>}` expression with no other characters → **full-value** resolution. The givens key receives the resolved value with its original type.
- A string that *contains* one or more `${...}` expressions among other text → **inline interpolation**. Each expression is replaced with `String(resolvedValue)`. The givens key receives a string. References that resolve to `undefined` are replaced with the empty string; numbers and booleans are coerced with `String()`; objects and arrays are stringified with `JSON.stringify()`.
- A string with no `${...}` expressions → **literal passthrough** (unchanged, regardless of `$` prefix).

All three expression families (`${writ}`, `${vars.*}`, `${yields.*}`) are supported in both full-value and inline modes. Spawn-time expressions (`${writ}`, `${writ.*}`, `${vars.*}`) are resolved at spawn time; `${yields.*}` expressions are resolved at engine start time. In inline mode, a string containing both spawn-time and yield expressions is partially resolved at spawn time (spawn-time expressions replaced, yield expressions left as literal `${yields.*}` text) and fully resolved at engine start time.

### Example: conversation chaining with prompt composition

```json
{
  "engines": [
    { "id": "reader", "designId": "anima-session",
      "givens": { "role": "${vars.plannerRole}", "prompt": "Inventory the codebase." } },
    { "id": "analyst", "designId": "anima-session", "upstream": ["reader"],
      "givens": {
        "role": "${vars.plannerRole}",
        "conversationId": "${yields.reader.conversationId}",
        "prompt": "Analyze the inventory and produce scope and decisions."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
